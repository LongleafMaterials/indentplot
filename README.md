# Tool to Parse and Plot Indentation Testing Data
I intend to develop this tool into a Python package to facilitate parsing, analysis, and visualization of indentation test data, e.g., nanoindentation, microindentation, etc. Documentation will be written after the package is created and functional. 

The first supported data format will be for Bruker software (.tdm, .hld, and .txt outputs), particularly that used for the [Hysitron PI 89](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/test-and-measurement/nanomechanical-instruments-for-sem-tem/hysitron-pi-89-sem-picoindenter.html).
